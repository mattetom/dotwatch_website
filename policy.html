<h1>Privacy policy</h1>

<h2>Information Collection</h2>

Your privacy is critically important to me. I have the following fundamental principles:
<ul>
<li>     I don’t ask you for personal information unless I need it for the application.</li>
<li>I don’t share/sell your personal information with anyone.</li>
<li>I don’t store your personal information.</li>
<li>I don’t transfer any personal information from your mobile.</li>
</ul>
All information is used only by Tomasini for the Wear OS Watch Face functionality purposes (display and configuration).
